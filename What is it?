Floating-Point:
The term floating point is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; 
that is, the decimal point can float. There are also representations in which the number of digits before and after 
the decimal point is set, called fixed-pointrepresentations. In general, floating-point representations are slower 
and less accurate than fixed-point representations, but they can handle a larger range of numbers.

One of the challenges in programming with floating-point values is ensuring that the approximations lead to reasonable results. 
If the programmeris not careful, small discrepancies in the approximations can snowball to the point where the final results 
become meaningless.

Because mathematics with floating-point numbers requires a great deal of computing power, many microprocessors come with a chip, 
called a floating point unit (FPU ), specialized for performing floating-point arithmetic. 
FPUs are also called math coprocessors and numeric coprocessors.
