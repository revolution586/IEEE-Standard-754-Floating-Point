A googol is the large number 10100. In decimal notation, it is written as the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeroes: 
10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

However, it is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles
in the visible universe or the number of hypothetical possibilities in a chess game. Kasner used it to illustrate the 
difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity, and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics.

A googolplex is the number 10googol, or equivalently, 10 ^ (10100).
