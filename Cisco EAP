WLAN - A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to 
form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, office building etc. 
This gives users the ability to move around within the area and yet still be connected to the network. 
Through a gateway, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.

Half-Duplex - A half-duplex (HDX) system provides communication in both directions, but only one direction at a 
time (not simultaneously). Typically, once a party begins receiving a signal, it must wait for the transmitter to stop 
transmitting, before replying.
An example of a half-duplex system is a two-party system such as a walkie-talkie, wherein one must use "over" or another 
previously designated keyword to indicate the end of transmission, and ensure that only one party transmits at a time, 
because both parties transmit and receive on the same frequency. 
Half-duplex systems are usually used to conserve bandwidth, since only a single communication channel is needed, 
which is shared alternately between the two directions.
In half-duplex systems, if more than one party transmits at the same time, a collision occurs, resulting in lost messages.

802.11 - The 802.11 family consists of a series of half-duplex over-the-air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol. 
The 802.11 protocol family employ carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance whereby equipment listens to a channel 
for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each packet.
//I didn't understand a word of that, but I think I get the idea//

802 - IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. 802 comes from the 
date these protocols were created, February 1980 (that's a theory, but I wanna believe it)
